this file holds one master pickle: all_image_info.pkl
which is a list of image items = [ [<url>, <x>, <y>, <first_imagenum>] ]
this file holds one complementary pickle: all_stats_info.pkl
which is a list of image items = [ [num_cg, num_ncg, num_jittered] ]

there are also configuration pickles: image_config_<x>.pkl
which is a dictionary with list values =
